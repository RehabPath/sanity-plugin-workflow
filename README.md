# Sanity Workflow Demo Plugin Example

With Sanity Studio you can [customize your content tools to support arbitrary workflows like assignment and content pipelines](https://www.sanity.io/docs/custom-workflows).

This plugin is distributed as a **reference implementation** of these customization APIs and is not considered to be a feature-complete implementation of what workflow management requires in production. It is a starting point intended to be forked and customized to the needs of your organization and content creators.

## Features

This work demonstrates how a single plugin can define:

- A unique schema to handle workflow metadata
- Document Actions to promote and demote documents through the workflow
- Document Badges for visual feedback about the current state of a document
- A custom Tool for drag-and-drop updating of a document's state

## Installation

```
npm install --save sanity-plugin-workflow@beta
```

or

```
yarn add sanity-plugin-workflow@beta
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in sanity.config.ts (or .js):

```js
 import {createConfig} from 'sanity'
 import {workflow} from 'sanity-plugin-workflow'

 export const createConfig({
    // all other settings ...
     plugins: [
         workflow({
            // Required, list of document type names
            // schemaTypes: ['article', 'product'],
            schemaTypes: [],
            // Optional, see type definitions for the structure of these
            states: [],
         })
     ]
 })
```
